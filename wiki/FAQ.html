# FAQ
---
### What's the difference between the original repo and the fork repos?
The [SM64EX](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex) fork repo has [additional features](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex/wiki/Build-options) compared to the original one.<br>
Instead, the [SM64NX](https://github.com/teamsalta/sm64nx/) fork can load modification without re-compiling the entire game.
### Where can I find help in case of problems?
You can go ask in one of the [Discord servers](../download.html) or in the [forum](https://sm64pc.info/).
### How do I make the game fullscreen?
Press left Alt + Enter or change it in the settings / config file.
### Full screen doesn't seem like the right resolution
Change high DPI settings by right clicking in the exe and then clicking on compatibility.
### Will my controller work?
Yes it should work automatically with an Xbox360, Xbox One, PS4, or other Xinput devices.<br>
If your controller doesn't work in game but does work on Steam then you can add the game to Steam and launch it that way.
<br>If that doesn't work either then use Joy2Key or DS4 Windows.
### I compiled the game and my PC says that OpenGL is too old. What do I do?
[SM64EX](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex) has a build option that can help you named [RENDER_API](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex/wiki/Build-options).
### Is there a way to compile the game for Raspberry Pi?
Yes! Check [this](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex/wiki/Helper-compiling-script-for-Raspberry-Pi).
