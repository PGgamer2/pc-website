# FAQ
---
### How does *this* work?
Once upon a time there was a [group of clever people](https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64) who decompiled SM64.
Thanks to these people, if you have a legitimate copy of the original ROM, you can now recompile the game for your OS.
### What's the difference between the original repo and the fork repos?
The [SM64EX](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex) fork repo has [additional features](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex/wiki/Build-options) compared to the original one.<br>
Instead, the [SM64NX](https://github.com/teamsalta/sm64nx/) fork can load modification without re-compiling the entire game.
### Where can I find help in case of problems?
You can go ask in one of the [Discord servers](../download.html) or in the [forum](https://sm64pc.info/).
### How do I make the game fullscreen?
Press left Alt + Enter or change it in the settings / config file.
### Full screen doesn't seem like the right resolution
Change high DPI settings by right clicking in the exe and then clicking on compatibility.
### Will my controller work?
Yes it should work automatically with an Xbox360, Xbox One, PS4, or other Xinput devices.<br>
If your controller doesn't work in game but does work on Steam then you can add the game to Steam and launch it that way.
<br>If that doesn't work either then use Joy2Key or DS4 Windows.
### I compiled the game and my PC says that OpenGL is too old. What do I do?
[SM64EX](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex) has a build option that can help you named [RENDER_API](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex/wiki/Build-options).
### Is there a way to compile the game for Raspberry Pi?
Yes! Check [this](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex/wiki/Helper-compiling-script-for-Raspberry-Pi).
### Can I decompile the game, change the code/textures/models and then recompile it?
Absolutely yes! More info about it on the [n64decomp repo](https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64/blob/master/README.md).
### Is there a way to use cheats into the game?
Yes, [go here](https://github.com/s4Ys369/CHEATERex).
### Can I play it multiplayer?
Yes! There's a [fork for coop multiplayer](https://github.com/djoslin0/sm64ex-coop).
### Can I compile the game for other OS?
At the moment there are forks for:
  * [Nintendo 3DS](https://github.com/sm64-port/sm64_3ds)
  * [PSP](https://github.com/z2442/sm64-port)
  * [Wii U](https://github.com/aboood40091/sm64-port)
  * [DOS](https://github.com/mkst/sm64-port/tree/dos)
  * [Android](https://github.com/VDavid003/sm64-port-android-base)
  * [PS Vita](https://github.com/bythos14/sm64-vita)
